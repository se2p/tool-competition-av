# Cyber-Physical Systems Testing Competition #

Starting this year, the [SBST Workshop](https://sbst21.github.io/) offers a challenge for software testers who want to work with self-driving cars in the context of the usual [tool competition](https://sbst21.github.io/tools/).

## Important Dates
The deadline to submit your tool is: **February 12th 2021**

The results of the evaluation will be communicated to participants on: **March 2nd 2021**

## Goal ##
The competitors should generate virtual roads to test a lane keeping assist system. 

The generated roads are evaluated in a driving simulator. We partnered with BeamNG GmbH which offers a version of their simulators for researchers, named [BeamNG.research](https://beamng.gmbh/research/). This simulator is ideal for researchers due to its state-of-the-art soft-body physics simulation, ease of access to sensory data, and a Python API to control the simulation.

## Implement Your Test Generator ##
We make available a [code pipeline](code_pipeline) that will integrate your test generator with the simulator by validating, executing and evaluating your test cases. Moreover, we offer some [sample test generators](sample_test_generators/README.md) to show how to use our code pipeline.

## Information About the Competition ##
More information can be found on the SBST tool competition website: [https://sbst21.github.io/tools/](https://sbst21.github.io/tools/)

## Repository Structure ##
[Code pipeline](code_pipeline): code that integrates your test generator with the simulator

[Self driving car testing library](self_driving): library that helps the integration of the test input generators, our code pipeline, and the BeamNG simulator

[Scenario template](levels_template/tig): basic scenario used in this competition

[Documentation](documentation/README.md): contains the installation guide, detailed rules of the competition, and the frequently asked questions

[Sample test generators](sample_test_generators/README.md): sample test generators already integrated with the code pipeline for illustrative purposes 

[Requirements](requirements-37.txt): contains the list of the required packages.
